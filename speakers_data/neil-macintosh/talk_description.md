The Guideline Support Library (GSL) is a set of portable vocabulary types for use in constructing safe and efficient C++ programs.
It has been developed to support the collaborative [C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines) effort - led by Bjarne Stroustrup - that provides a set of guidelines
on how to use modern C++ most effectively.

This talk provides an introduction to the GSL as well as the motivations and principles behind it.
There will be a review of the current set of facilities in the library. Then the talk will present
specific guidance on how to use key types from the GSL. The talk will walk through in-depth examples of transforming code to use
the new types and functions.

The talk includes pointers to existing and upcoming implementations of the GSL. The talk will look in particular at Microsoft's
open-source, reference [implementation of the GSL](https://github.com/Microsoft/GSL). It will cover portability, performance, and lessons learned. Finally, there will
be a status report on notable places the GSL is in use today and discussion of what is next for the GSL.
